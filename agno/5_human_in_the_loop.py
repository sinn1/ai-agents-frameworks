# In this example, we explore Agno's Agent class with the following features:
# - Human-in-the-loop (pre-hooks on tool calling)
# - Streaming outputs from tools
#
# This example is from: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/d3cceaf34db84f57d694be3f446a976aaa80a201/cookbook/getting_started/19_human_in_the_loop.py

""" Human-in-the-Loop: Adding User Confirmation to Tool Calls

This example shows how to implement human-in-the-loop functionality in your Agno tools.
It shows how to:
- Add pre-hooks to tools for user confirmation
- Handle user input during tool execution
- Gracefully cancel operations based on user choice

Some practical applications:
- Confirming sensitive operations before execution
- Reviewing API calls before they're made
- Validating data transformations
- Approving automated actions in critical systems
