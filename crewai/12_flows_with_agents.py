-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore CrewAI's Flows with integrated agents:
- Integration of agents and crews within flow steps
- Structured state management using Pydantic models
- @start() decorator for flow entry points
- @listen() decorator for method chaining and event listening
- Passing structured data between agents and flow steps
- Asynchronous execution of flows
- Automatic flow visualization (see "plots/" folder)

This demonstrates how to:
1. Orchestrate multi-agent workflows using Flows
2. Pass structured outputs between agents and flow steps
3. Use Pydantic models for robust state and output management
