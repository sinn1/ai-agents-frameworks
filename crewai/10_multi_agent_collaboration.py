-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore CrewAI's agents with the following features:
- Multi-agent crews
- Agent collaboration and delegation
- Sequential vs. Hierarchical collaboration patterns
- Task decomposition and assignment

When delegation is enabled, CrewAI agents automatically gain
the ability to delegate tasks and ask questions to their teammates.
Their given 2 powerful tools to facilitate collaboration:
1. Delegate Work tool
2. Ask Question tool
