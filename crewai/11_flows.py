-------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore CrewAI's agents with the following features:
- Structured state management using Pydantic models
- @start() decorator for flow entry points
- @listen() decorator for method chaining and event listening
- @router() decorator for conditional routing logic
- and_() function for waiting on multiple conditions
- or_() function for listening to multiple events
- State persistence and management throughout the flow
- Flow visualization with automatic plot generation (in "plots/" folder)
- Multiple execution paths with conditional branching

When using Flows, CrewAI provides powerful AI workflow orchestration with:
1. Event-driven architecture for responsive workflows
2. Flexible control flow with conditional logic and routing
3. Robust state management for data sharing between tasks
4. Automatic visualization for understanding flow structure

For better visualization, I recommend running the code, check the terminal logs,
and then view the generated flow plot in the "plots/" folder.
